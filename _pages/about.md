<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My name is Yikang Zhou (周毅康), I’m currently a sophomore at the School of Computer, Wuhan University, pursuing a B.E. degree in Artificial Intelligence. I graduated from Fuzhou No.1 High School, where I spent 1 year learning Mathematical Olympic.

My research interest includes multimodal large language models, 3D vision and embodied intelligence.🤝🤝
I’m open to any possible discussions or collaborate opportunities. If you’re interested in working with me, don’t hesitate to drop me an email!📧
